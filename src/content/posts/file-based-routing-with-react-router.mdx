**⌁ Check out [Generouted](https://github.com/oedotme/generouted) if you want to use client-side file-based routing**. It provides more features than what's covered here, multiple frameworks support and multiple routers integrations!

Most React applications involve a routing setup to allow user navigation between different pages. There are two common ways to handle routing in React depending on your rendering method.

You probably know React Router, a widely used library for declarative/component-based client-side routing. With server-side rendering, React frameworks like Next.js offer an alternative approach called file-based routing.

In a **traditional client-side React routing** setup with React router, you'll declare your routes within a `<Switch />` component by adding a `<Route/>` component for each page, specifying a path and a corresponding component to be rendered as a page. **It works fine but it lacks universal convention**. Also when declaring many routes it becomes **hard to follow**, at least in my experience.

**With file-based routing** you don't import page components manually. Instead you define all your routes by adding/removing/renaming files within a directory called `pages` by convention. **Each file inside the `pages` directory will represent a route in your application.** That makes it easier to visualize and manage as the `pages` directory structure reflects all existing routes. You can also have dynamic routes with special file names and nested routes with sub-directories. We'll discuss some of the file-based routing common patterns shortly.

Today I want to share with you how I'm using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) to **build a file-based routing for client-side React applications** inspired by [Next.js file-based routing conventions](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction), **in 30 lines of code and one awesome Vite feature.**

Before we get started let's talk about **why you might prefer using file-based routing** over the traditional component-based approach with client-side routing:

- It's a **universal routing convention** whether using Next.js or just React
- Routes are **automatically updated** by adding/removing/renaming files at the `pages` directory
- Routes are represented in an **easy-to-follow file tree** and grouped by nesting
- It only needs a **one-time straight forward setup** that is flexible and extendable
- It's **easier to migrate** when switching from or to Next.js

---

Don't worry if you've never used Next.js or file-based routing previously, it's quite easy to grasp. Basically each file inside the `pages` directory will represent a route by its name and its exported component.

Therefore naming files within the `pages` directory should be done according to the URL/path you want to give to the route. Let's say you want to add a page at `/about` path, you just need a file inside the `pages` directory at `pages/about.tsx` and the component to be rendered with this path will be exported from this same file.

Here are some examples of file paths and their corresponding URLs for **commonly used patterns in file-based routing**. We'll be using `src/pages` as the `pages` directory:

**Index routes**

- `src/pages/index.tsx` → `/`
- `src/pages/posts/index.tsx` → `/posts`

**Nested routes**

- `src/pages/posts/topic.tsx` → `/posts/topic`
- `src/pages/settings/profile.tsx` → `/settings/profile`

**Dynamic routes**

- `src/pages/posts/[slug].tsx` → `/posts/:slug`
- `src/pages/[user]/settings.tsx` → `/:user/settings`
- `src/pages/posts/[...all].tsx` → `/posts/*`

---

In the following sections we'll be covering all the patterns above.

## Getting started

First of all we need to setup a React project with Vite.

You can [scaffold a Vite project](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) with React and TypeScript by using `--template react-ts`:

```shell
npm init vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react-ts
```

Then add `react-router-dom` as a dependency:

```shell
npm install react-router-dom
```

## Configuring routes

Let's now setup the file-based routing that will allow us to get the routes from the files in the `pages` directory. We only have to make this setup once. Then we can update the routes by simply adding/removing/renaming files inside the `pages` directory.

In order to import all pages modules we'll be using a [glob import API](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#glob-import) that comes with Vite. It works by specifying a pattern to find certain type of files. In our case we want to find/match React components inside the `pages` directory, so we'll specify a pattern to look for files only in `pages` directory that ends with `.tsx` extension. The glob matching is done via `fast-glob`, if you want to update the pattern we're using or use different patterns check its documentation for [supported glob patterns](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#pattern-syntax).

The glob matching will give us an object with each matching module path as a key and its corresponding exports as value. Then we need to transform this object into an array of objects each having `path` and `component` properties to be used with the `<Route />` component.

We'll be using `import.meta.globEager` to **import all modules directly**:

```tsx
// src/routes.tsx

const ROUTES = import.meta.globEager('/src/pages/**/[a-z[]*.tsx')
```

The result of this pattern will only include files starting with a lowercase letter `a-z` or an opening square bracket `[` and ending with `.tsx` file extension. You can modify the pattern above to **support `.jsx` files too** by replacing `.tsx` with `.{tsx,jsx}`.

That will give us an object as we mentioned earlier with each matching module path as a key and its corresponding exports as value:

```tsx
ROUTES = {
  '/src/pages/index.tsx': { default: ƒ Index(), ... },
  '/src/pages/posts/index.tsx': { default: ƒ PostsIndex(), ... },
  '/src/pages/posts/[slug].tsx': { default: ƒ PostsSlug(), ... },
  ...
}
```

We can now use the `map` method to iterate over the `ROUTES` object keys and create a new **array of objects each having a path and its corresponding `default export` as a component**:

```tsx
const routes = Object.keys(ROUTES).map((route) => {
  const path = route
    .replace(/\/src\/pages|index|\.tsx$/g, '')
    .replace(/\[\.{3}.+\]/, '*')
    .replace(/\[(.+)\]/, ':$1')

  return { path, component: ROUTES[route].default }
})
```

Then we transform each file path to its corresponding URL by using `replace` method to:

- Remove `/src/pages`, `index` and `.tsx` from each path
- Replace `[...param]` patterns with `*`
- Replace `[param]` patterns with `:param`

The above code will result in the following array after mapping:

```tsx
routes = [
  { path: '/', component: ƒ Index() },
  { path: '/posts', component: ƒ PostsIndex() },
  { path: '/posts/:slug', component: ƒ PostsSlug() },
  ...
]
```

That was a fairly simple implementation for a flat `routes` array. You can also check React Router's [static route config](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/main/packages/react-router-config) package or their [route config](https://reactrouter.com/web/example/route-config) example to see different approaches.

And finally we can `map` over the `routes` array to render each route:

```tsx
export const Routes = () => {
  return (
    <Switch>
      {routes.map(({ path, component: Component = Fragment }) => (
        <Route key={path} path={path} component={Component} exact={true} />
      ))}
    </Switch>
  )
}
```

Now, by simply importing this `<Routes />` component in your application entry, wrapped by a `<BrowserRouter />` you'll get the file-based client-side routing working with React.

## Preserved files

Next.js comes with some preserved files like `pages/_app` and `pages/404`. Although this part is **optional for both implementation and usage**, we'll be adding `pages/_app` and `pages/404` as they're often used. Thus, we also stick to Next.js conventions.

We'll use another glob pattern to get those two files and set them as preserved files:

```tsx
const PRESERVED = import.meta.globEager('/src/pages/(_app|404).tsx')
```

The result will be similar to `ROUTES` in structure but we'll transform it slightly:

```tsx
PRESERVED = {
  '/src/pages/_app.tsx': { default: ƒ App(), ... },
  '/src/pages/404.tsx': { default: ƒ NotFound(), ... }
}
```

We'll just format the `PRESERVED` object keys, and set the corresponding `default export` component as value for each key:

```tsx
const preserved = Object.keys(PRESERVED).reduce((preserved, file) => {
  const key = file.replace(/\/src\/pages\/|\.tsx$/g, '')
  return { ...preserved, [key]: PRESERVED[file].default }
}, {})
```

And the resulting object will be as following:

```tsx
preserved = {
  '_app': ƒ App(),
  '404': ƒ NotFound()
}
```

Finally we check if preserved files exist to be used. If it doesn't or if there's no default export we'll render a `<Fragment />` instead:

```tsx
export const Routes = () => {
  const App = preserved?.['_app'] || Fragment
  const NotFound = preserved?.['404'] || Fragment

  return (
    <App>
      <Switch>
        {routes.map(({ path, component: Component = Fragment }) => (
          <Route key={path} path={path} component={Component} exact={true} />
        ))}
        <Route path="*" component={NotFound} />
      </Switch>
    </App>
  )
}
```

## Final code

Putting all the pieces from the above sections together it should be as following:

```tsx
// src/routes.tsx

import React, { Fragment } from 'react'
import { Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom'

const PRESERVED = import.meta.globEager('/src/pages/(_app|404).tsx')
const ROUTES = import.meta.globEager('/src/pages/**/[a-z[]*.tsx')

const preserved = Object.keys(PRESERVED).reduce((preserved, file) => {
  const key = file.replace(/\/src\/pages\/|\.tsx$/g, '')
  return { ...preserved, [key]: PRESERVED[file].default }
}, {})

const routes = Object.keys(ROUTES).map((route) => {
  const path = route
    .replace(/\/src\/pages|index|\.tsx$/g, '')
    .replace(/\[\.{3}.+\]/, '*')
    .replace(/\[(.+)\]/, ':$1')

  return { path, component: ROUTES[route].default }
})

export const Routes = () => {
  const App = preserved?.['_app'] || Fragment
  const NotFound = preserved?.['404'] || Fragment

  return (
    <App>
      <Switch>
        {routes.map(({ path, component: Component = Fragment }) => (
          <Route key={path} path={path} component={Component} exact={true} />
        ))}
        <Route path="*" component={NotFound} />
      </Switch>
    </App>
  )
}
```

And the application entry will be updated as following:

```tsx
// src/main.tsx

import React, { StrictMode } from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'

import { Routes } from './routes'

render(
  <StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
)
```

Now you only need to add/remove/rename files at the `src/pages` directory to manage your routes.

And **that's how the directory structure should look like** after starter code files cleanup and having couple of routes in the `src/pages` directory:

```shell
.
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── src
│   ├── main.tsx
│   ├── pages
│   │   ├── about.tsx
│   │   ├── index.tsx
│   │   └── posts
│   │       └── [slug].tsx
│   ├── routes.tsx
│   └── vite-env.d.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

## Additional info ⌁

Adding/removing/renaming routes doesn't need a server restart, **Vite automatically hot reloads/updates** when `pages` directory is updated as the routes import changes.

You can access a page dynamic parameter by using React Router's `useParams()` hook. The parameter's name corresponds to what's inside of the square brackets of the file name:

```tsx
// src/pages/posts/[slug].tsx

import React from 'react'
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom'

export default function Post() {
  const { slug } = useParams<{ slug: string }>()

  return <h1>Post: {slug}</h1>
}
```

## What's next

If you want to see **full project example of file-based routing with client-side React**, check out [Render](https://github.com/oedotme/render) — a React template I've setup while trying [pre-rendering with Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr.html#pre-rendering-ssg). You can find Render's routing configuration at [`src/config/routes.tsx`](https://github.com/oedotme/render/blob/main/src/config/routes.tsx). On this configuration you'll also see that pages can export a `meta.scope` variable to set a `private` or `public` scope.

I'll be updating Render to [enable automatic route-based code-splitting and lazy-loading with this file-based routing we've setup](https://omarelhawary.me/blog/file-based-routing-with-react-router-code-splitting), I'm planning to write about that in a future post. I got pre-rendering and file-based routing working together with Vite. And server-side rendering should work as well with very few additions.

Note that this concept is also applicable to other JavaScript frameworks than React if you're using Vite, as it's what powers this file-base routing.

Vite is a very powerful tool that opens a lot of possibilities as you can build many features on top of it. I only scratched the surface but you can go further and build a framework-like experience.

**I would love to hear what you think about this file-based routing approach**, feel free to leave a comment on the discussion. If you have questions or got stuck at some point I'll be happy to help.
